# awesome-two-stage-summarization

### Scope
Here we list all of papers related to two-stage neural summarization. Summarization can be extractive or abstractive. The two-stage aspect is defined broadly speaking as any method which involves re-training a base sequence-to-sequence summarization model *which has already been fine-tuned* (using the summary labels from the given dataset).
